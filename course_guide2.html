                            To illustrate that, Goldblatt recounted how a FedEx representative offered him such a big discount that he felt compelled to scribble out the write-down price quote to prevent it from being shown to anyone else. That proposal, and discretion masking it, were ultimately in vain, because Goldblatt decided to keep his shipping business with UPS—though only after it offered him an even bigger cut than FedEx. Small business owners who haven’t received similar offers by now should probably take matters into their own hands and sound out their shipping company—and its main competitor—about possible discounts. FedEx, for example, told the Journal its salespeople are mostly identifying companies with parcel traffic profiles that correspond to its own organizational and operation strengths, and aren’t randomly contacting potential clients. That means not everyone will be as fortunate Houston entrepreneur Machiorlette, who FedEx contacted with an offer to cut $7 off the $29 cost UPS charged her for large packages. “We were excited that they were willing to court our business,” Machiorlette told the paper—mentioning that the subsequent savings allowed her to underwrite potential return shipping costs.
