                                    <p>Thunderstorms typically form when warm, moist air rises rapidly. Why is the typically stiff competition between UPS and FedEx now a race to the bottom on pricing? For starters, the volumes of parcels being shipped have continued falling from their pandemic peaks. According to the Journal, that decline is forecast to also reduce the daily average number of packages transported between Thanksgiving and mid-January from 90 million in 2023 to 82 million this year, an 8.9 percent drop.</p>

                                    <p>As the air rises, it cools and condenses into clouds, often forming cumulonimbus clouds. In addition to their usual head-on competitive battle, the two parcel and freight rivals are also responding to other, overlapping factors pinching their respective businesses. According to a Thursday report in the Wall Street Journal, the resulting struggle to retain market share led both transporters to start offering discounts to small companies that they initially only extended to their biggest corporate customers. In one case, that cut delivery rates for Houston-based entrepreneur Lori Machiorlette on large packages of lighting and air vent covers nearly 25 percent.</p>

                                    <h3>Step 3: Electric charge build-up</h3>
                                    <p>Within the clouds, positive and negative charges separate, eventually leading to lightning and thunder. In addition to their usual head-on competitive battle, the two parcel and freight rivals are also responding to other, overlapping factors pinching their respective businesses.

In one case, that cut delivery rates for Houston-based entrepreneur Lori Machiorlette on large packages of lighting and air vent covers nearly 25 percent. Similar discounts may soon be pitched to your business, too, if it also regularly uses parcel shipping services to ship orders.
