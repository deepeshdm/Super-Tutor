Why is the typically stiff competition between UPS and FedEx now a race to the bottom on pricing? For starters, the volumes of parcels being shipped have continued falling from their pandemic peaks. According to the Journal, that decline is forecast to also reduce the daily average number of packages transported between Thanksgiving and mid-January from 90 million in 2023 to 82 million this year, an 8.9 percent drop.
